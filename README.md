# AI-Resume-Analyzer
AI-powered Resume Analyzer built with Streamlit that compares resumes against job descriptions using semantic similarity, skill matching, and keyword analysis — no heavy NLP frameworks required.

The AI Resume Analyzer is a Streamlit-based web application that helps job seekers evaluate and optimize their resumes against specific job descriptions using modern NLP techniques.

Instead of relying on rule-based matching, this project uses semantic similarity with Sentence Transformers to understand contextual alignment between a resume and a job description. It also performs skill extraction, keyword gap analysis, and resume optimization suggestions, making it suitable for ATS-style screening simulations.
